Ayanna Narrow Font
===================

Ayanna is a narrow font intended for titles and short texts in the web, with support for Sinhala, Tamil, and Latin.

With Tamil and Latin languages support, this Ayanna provides a complete solution for Sinhala Tamil and English trilingual design typical in Sri Lanka. 
Slightly condensed shapes and dimensions make it possible to fit more text in a line. 
The x-height of Latin and body height of Sinhala and Tamil is generous, and has short ascenders and descenders, increasing the space efficiency. 
It has a somewhat neutral personality with a touch of soft and smooth curves that add some whimsy. 
Ayanna will perform well when used in headlines, subheads and shorter text blocks such as pull quotes. 
Tamil glyphs are designed to cater the same typographic needs, with open counters and a friendly feel. 
Sinhala glyphs have some peculiarities and experimental shapes that were invented to perform well as a display face while belonging in the formal text typeface category. 
Make sure you check out all these features before using it. 
Ayanna comes in six weights, and the extralight weight is pleasingly beautiful and stylish for headlines.

This project is a benchmark project for Sinhala type design projects by Mooniak. 
The research, learnings, and tools developed along the way are documented and shared under open and free licenses. 
The name ‘Ayanna’ comes from the name of the first letter of Sinhala alphabet, අ.

The project is led by designers of Mooniak, the collaborative collective of creatives based in Colombo, Sri Lanka. 
Sol Matas contributed Latin design. 
Intial release of the font is funded by Google Fonts.

අඩුවෙන් ඉඩ අයත්කරගන්නා, අන්තර්ගතයන්ට මෙන්ම අභිධානයන්ටද එකලෙස යෙදිය හැකි සිංහල දෙමළ මෙන්ම ඉංග්‍රීසි භාෂාවේ අකුරු වලිනුත් සමන්විත ‘අයන්න’ ශ්‍රී ලාංකීය ජාතියේ උන්නතිය අරමුණු කොටගෙන ඔබේ අත්ලට පිරිනමන අපගේ අලුත්ම ෆොන්ට නිකුතුවයි.

## How to contribute

This project is a Libre/Open project. There are many different ways you can help us.

- Share, copy and spread the fonts, tell your friends
- Help us test fonts and report any issues you see in fonts, there are small things in the design that we'd like to hear about
- If you are interested in designing type, you can help us add more glyphs and language support
- Get in touch if you would like specific features implemented

## How To Build

If you want your way around fonts and terminal, you can use our build system to fonts.To generate fonts we use a virtual enviromant created with Vagrant. See [WeliPilla](https://github.com/mooniak/WeliPilla) for more info.

Once you have Welipilla set up, do the following..

- Run Vagrant box, this will take a few minuits to set up the build enviroment.

```shell
$vagrant up
```

- SSH into vagrant box.(Use putty on Windows)
```shell
$vagrant ssh
```

- Run builder script.
```shell
$cd /vagrant/scripts && sh builder.sh
```
