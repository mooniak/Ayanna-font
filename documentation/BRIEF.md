Yaldevi Font Brief (previously Ayanna)
==============

Following is the intial email posted on Google Fonts discussion list outlining the project.
 A narrow family meant for titling, captions and smaller text chunks supporting Sinhala, Tamil and Latin. Sinhala and Tamil design will try to simplify some of the more complex shapes and would have a bit of experimental shapes, hopefully not offending.

We are doing a full documentation of Sinhala, this will be the base that we will be using for our future Sinhala projects as well.
